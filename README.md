Hogwarts Houses Webpage

This project is a simple webpage showcasing the four Hogwarts houses from the Harry Potter universe. The page uses media queries for responsiveness and features interactive buttons for each house.

Features

Hogwarts Houses Display: Each house (Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaw) has its own section with a background image.

View Buttons: Each house has a button that can be linked to further details.

Flexbox Layout: Ensures a clean and flexible arrangement of elements.

Technologies Used

HTML

CSS (Including media queries for responsiveness)
